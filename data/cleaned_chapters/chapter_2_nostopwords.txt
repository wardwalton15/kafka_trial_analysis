moving fro narrow passage may division two factions idea reinforced fact first rows left right hardly face looking direction saw nothing backs people directing speech movements towards members side dressed black old long formal frock coats hung loosely around clothes thing puzzled would otherwise taken whole assembly local political meeting end hall led little table set angle low podium overcrowded everywhere else behind table near edge podium sat small fat wheezing man talking someone behind second man standing legs crossed elbows backrest chair provoking much laughter time time threw arm air caricature someone youth leading difficulty reporting man already tried twice tell something standing tiptoe without getting man attention sat one people podium drew attention youth man turned leant hear quietly said pulled watch quickly looked one hour five minutes ago said going give reply time hardly man spoken general muttering arose right hand side hall one hour five minutes ago man repeated raising voice time quickly looked round hall beneath muttering also became immediately louder man said nothing died away gradually hall much quieter entered people gallery stopped passing remarks far could distinguished dust haze seemed less well dressed many brought pillows put heads ceiling would hurt pressed decided would watching talking defend supposedly come late simply said well maybe arrived late followed loud applause right hand side hall easy people get side thought bothered quiet left hand side directly behind applause individuals wondered could say get support together possible least get support others yes said man longer obligation hear case muttering time misleading man waved people objections aside hand continued however exception continue today never arrive late like step forward someone jumped podium would place free stepped onto stood pressed closely table press crowd behind great press back want push desk podium perhaps judge along judge however paid attention sat comfortably chair saying words close discussion man behind reached little note book item desk like old school exercise book become quite misshapen much thumbing said judge thumbing book turned tone someone knows facts said house painter said chief clerk large bank reply followed laughter among right hand faction hall hearty could stop joining people supported hands knees shook suffering serious attack coughing even gallery laughing judge become quite cross seemed power hall tried reduce harm done gallery jumped threatening eyebrows hardly remarkable pushed became big black bushy eyes left hand side hall still quiet though people stood rows faces looking towards podium listening said observed noise side hall quietness even allowed individuals ranks go forward faction people left faction fewer number right probably important although behaviour calmer made seem like began speak convinced way question lord whether house painter fact even ask merely imposed symptomatic whole way proceedings carried perhaps object proceedings quite right proceedings acknowledge moment acknowledge pity large extent impossible observe business without feeling pity say things done without due care would like make clear make acknowledgement stopped speaking looked hall spoken sharply sharply intended quite right rewarded applause everything quiet clearly waiting would follow perhaps quietness laying ground outbreak activity would bring whole affair end somewhat disturbing door end hall opened young washerwoman seemed finished work came despite caution attracted attention people judge gave direct pleasure seemed immediately struck words listened standing speech taken surprise directing attention gallery pause sat slowly want anyone notice took notebook probably could give impression calmer wo help sir continued even little book confirm say satisfied hear nothing quiet words room full strangers even dared casually pick examining judge notebook touching tips fingers something revolting lifted air holding one middle pages others side closely written blotted yellowing flapped official notes examining judge said let notebook fall onto desk read book much like sir really anything charge book afraid even though access would want hand touch two fingers judge grabbed notebook fallen desk could sign deep humiliation least must perceived tried tidy little held front order read people front row looked showing tension faces looked back time every one old man white beards could perhaps crucial group could turn whole assembly one way sunk state motionlessness gave oration possible raise passivity even judge humiliated happened continued less vigour earlier continually scanned faces first row gave address somewhat nervous distracted character happened isolated case would much importance much importance symptom proceedings carried many behalf stand alone without intended raised voice somewhere hall someone raised hands applauded shouting bravo bravo say bravo men first row groped around beards none looked round see shouting even thought importance raise spirits longer thought necessary hall applaud enough majority began think matter one persuaded trying successful orator said thought probably capable anyway sure examining judge speak far better part job want public discussion public wrong listen ten days ago placed arrest arrest something laugh beside point came morning still bed maybe order given arrest house painter seems possible judge said someone innocent chose two police thugs occupying next room could taken better precautions dangerous robber policemen unprincipled talked till sick wanted bribes wanted trick giving clothes wanted money supposedly could bring breakfast blatantly eaten breakfast front eyes even enough led front supervisor another room room lady lot respect forced look supervisor policemen made quite mess room although fault mine easy stay calm managed completely calm asked supervisor arrest would confirm say see sitting chair belonging lady mentioned picture arrogance think answered told gentlemen basically nothing perhaps really know nothing placed arrest satisfied fact done brought three junior employees bank work lady room made busy interfering photographs belonged lady causing mess course another reason bringing employees like landlady maid expected spread news arrest damage public reputation particular remove position bank well succeed slightest even landlady quite simple person give name full respect name grubach even grubach understanding enough see arrest like significance attack carried street youths kept proper control repeat whole affair caused nothing unpleasantness temporary irritation could also far worse consequences broke looked judge said nothing thought saw judge use movement eyes give sign someone crowd smiled said judge right next giving secret sign someone among seems someone among taking directions know whether sign meant produce booing applause resist trying guess meaning soon really matter give lordship judge full public permission stop giving secret signs paid subordinate give orders words instead let say next time whether embarrassment impatience judge rocked backwards forwards seat man behind talking earlier leant forward either give general words encouragement specific piece advice hall people talked quietly animatedly two factions earlier seemed hold views strongly opposed began intermingle individuals pointed others pointed judge air room fuggy extremely oppressive standing furthest away could hardly even seen must especially troublesome visitors gallery forced quietly ask participants assembly exactly happening albeit timid glances judge replies received quiet given behind protection raised hand nearly finished say said bell available struck desk fist way startled judge advisor made look none concerns therefore able make calm assessment assuming court real importance much advantage listen say want discuss say please bother write later time waste soon leaving immediate silence showed well control crowd shouts among start even applauded already persuaded seemed close pleased tension among people listened rustling rose silence invigorating ecstatic applause could doubt said quietly enormous organisation determining said court case includes arrest examination taking place today organisation employs policemen bribed oafish supervisors judges nothing better said arrogant others organisation even maintains judiciary along train countless servants scribes policemen assistance needs perhaps even executioners torturers afraid using words gentlemen purpose enormous organisation purpose arrest innocent people wage pointless prosecutions case lead result avoid office becoming deeply corrupt everything devoid meaning impossible even highest judge would able achieve policemen try steal clothes back arrest supervisors break homes people know innocent people humiliated front crowds rather given proper trial policemen talked warehouses put property arrest would like see warehouses hard possessions people arrest left decay stolen thieving hands warehouse workers interrupted screeching far end hall shaded eyes see far dull light day made smoke whitish hard see washerwoman recognised likely source disturbance soon entered hard see whether fault could see man pulled corner
