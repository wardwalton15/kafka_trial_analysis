director understood also spoke although ought foreseen italian came south country director also spent several years whatever cause realised possibility communicating italian largely taken even french difficult understand moustache concealed movements lips might offered help understanding said began anticipate many difficulties gave trying understand italian said director could understand easily would pointless effort time scowl italian relaxed sitting deep comfortable armchair frequently pulled short sharply tailored jacket one time lifted arms air moved hands freely try depict something

turning round leaving eventually italian looked clock jumped taking leave director turned pressing close push chair back could move director doubt seen anxiety eyes tried cope dialect italian joined

difficult see anything cathedral standing cold flagstones might well make chill much worse square front cathedral quite empty remembered even small child noticed nearly houses narrow square curtains windows closed time although today weather like understandable cathedral also seemed quite empty course would think going day like hurried along side naves saw old woman wrapped warm shawl kneeling picture virgin mary staring distance saw church official limped away doorway wall arrived time struck ten entering building italian still went back main entrance stood indecisively walked round cathedral rain case italian waiting another entrance nowhere found could director misunderstood time agreed could anyone understand someone like properly anyway whatever happened would wait least half

bent back peace work completed cathedral quiet would disturb silence intention staying duty preach certain time regardless circumstances could could without taking part presence would nothing augment effect began slowly move felt way tiptoe along pew arrived broad aisle went along without disturbed except sound steps however light rang stone floor resounded vaulting quiet continuous repeating regular pace felt slightly abandoned probably observed priest walked empty pews size cathedral seemed limit man could bear arrived back sitting hesitate simply reached album left took nearly left area
