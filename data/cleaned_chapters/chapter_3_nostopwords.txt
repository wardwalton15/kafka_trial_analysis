wooden stairs would explain nothing however long stared noticed small piece paper next went across read childish unpractised hand entrance court offices court offices attic tenement accommodated attract much respect comfort accused realise little money court disposal locate offices place tenants building among poorest people would throw unneeded junk hand possible officials enough money squandered rather use court purposes going experience far even seemed probable except court allowed decay way would humiliate accused also give encouragement court simply state poverty also understood court ashamed summon accused attic building initial hearing preferred impose upon homes position found compared judge sitting attic bank big office enormous window could look activity square true
