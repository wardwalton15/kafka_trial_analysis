lawyer manufacturer painter one winter morning snow falling dull light outside sitting office already extremely tired despite early hour told servitor engaged major piece work none junior staff allowed see would disturbed least instead working turned round chair slowly moved various items around desk without aware lay arm stretched desk top sat immobile head sunk chest longer able get thought trial head often wondered whether might good idea work written defence hand court would contain short description life explain acted way event way important whether considered acted well ill reasons doubt advantages written defence sort would relying lawyer anyway without shortcomings idea actions lawyer taking certainly lot month since lawyer summoned none previous discussions given impression man would able much importantly asked hardly questions many questions asked asking questions important thing feeling would able ask questions needed lawyer contrast ask questions talking sat silently facing leant forward slightly desk probably hard hearing pulled strand hair middle beard looked carpet perhaps spot lain leni would give vague warning sort give children speeches pointless boring decided final bill came would pay penny lawyer thought humiliated sufficiently usually started something would raise spirits already would say many cases partly whole cases may really difficult one face even less hope success list cases drawer would tap one drawers desk could unfortunately show dealt official secrets nonetheless great experience acquired cases would course benefit course begun work straight away nearly ready submit first documents would important first impression made defence often determine whole course proceedings unfortunately though would still make clear first documents submitted sometimes even read court simply put documents point time questioning observing accused much important anything written applicant becomes insistent add come decision soon material brought together due regard course documents first documents submitted also checked unfortunately even usually true first documents submitted usually mislaid lost completely even keep right end hardly read although lawyer knew rumour regrettable entirely without justifications forget trial would public court deems necessary made public law says result accused defence access even court records especially indictment means generally know least precisely first documents need means contain anything relevance case lucky coincidence anything individual charges reasons comes clearly guessed accused questioned possible work submit documents really direct issue present proof conditions like course place defence unfavourable difficult position intend fact defence really allowed law tolerated even dispute whether relevant parts law imply even strictly speaking thing counsel acknowledged court anyone comes court counsel basically barrack room lawyer effect course remove dignity whole procedure next time court offices might like look lawyers room seen might well quite shocked people sees assembled room allocated narrow space low ceiling enough show contempt court people light room comes little window high want look first get one colleagues support back even smoke chimney front go nose make face black floor room give yet another example conditions hole year big man could fall big enough foot disappear lawyers room second floor attic foot go hang first floor attic underneath right corridor litigants waiting exaggeration lawyers say conditions like disgrace complaints management slightest effect lawyers strictly forbidden alter anything room expense even treating lawyers way reasons want far possible prevent kind defence everything made responsibility accused bad point view basically nothing could mistaken think lawyers necessary accused court contrary court less needed proceedings generally kept secret public also accused far possible course possible large extent accused get see court records either difficult infer court records said questioning based especially accused difficult situation faced every possible worry distract defence begins counsel defence normally allowed present accused questioned afterwards possible still door interview room learn extract whatever might use even though accused report often confused important thing really lot learned way although anything else competent man learn another nonetheless important thing lawyer personal connections real value taking counsel lies likely already learned experience among lowest orders court organisation imperfections court strictly closed public staff forget duty take bribes extent show gaps lawyers push way bribes paid information extracted even earlier times least incidents documents stolen denying surprisingly favourable results attained accused way limited time petty advocates strut fro basis attract new clients course proceedings signifies either nothing nothing good things real value honest personal contacts contacts higher officials albeit higher officials lower grades understand way progress trial influenced hardly noticeable first true becomes visible course many lawyers made good choice matter probably one two many contacts huld bother company lawyers room nothing means less contact court officials necessary huld go court wait examining judges turn turn try achieve something according judges mood usually apparent real often even seen court officials including quite high come forward without asked glad give information fully open least easy understand discuss next stages proceedings fact cases quite willing adopt person point view however happens never trust far however firmly may declared new point view favour defendant might well go straight back offices write report court says opposite might well even harder defendant original view one insist fully dissuaded course way defending something said private indeed private used public something makes easy defence keep gentlemen favour hand also true gentlemen become involved defence course done great expertise philanthropic reasons order friendly respects would truer say allocated disadvantages court structure right start stipulates proceedings take place private come force normal mediocre trials officials contact public well equipped normal trials run course almost need nudge faced cases especially difficult lost often ones simple forced spend time day night laws right feel human relationships serious shortcoming cases like come advice lawyer servant behind carrying documents normally kept secret could seen many gentlemen window gentlemen would least expect staring window despair street lawyer desk studying documents give good advice times like also possible see exceptionally seriously gentlemen take professions thrown great confusion difficulties natures overcome easy position regard positions easy would injustice different ranks hierarchies court endless even someone knows way around always tell going happen even junior officials proceedings courtrooms usually kept secret hardly able see cases work proceed court affairs appear range vision often without knowing come move without learning go civil servants like able learn things learn studying successive stages individual trials go final verdict reasons allowed deal part trial law allocates usually know less results work left defence even though defence usually stay contact accused trial nearly end court officials learn many useful things defence bearing mind still surprise officials irritated often express litigants unflattering ways experience shared everyone officials irritated even appear calm causes many difficulties junior advocates course story instance much ring truth goes like one older officials good peaceful man dealing difficult matter court become confused especially thanks contributions lawyers studying day night without break officials indeed hard working works hard nearly morning working hours probably little result went front entrance waited ambush every time lawyer tried enter building would throw steps lawyers gathered together front steps discussed one hand actually right allowed building hardly anything could legally official already mentioned would careful set officials hand day spent court day lost matter importance force way inside end agreed would try tire old man one lawyer another sent run steps let thrown offering resistance could long passive resistance colleagues would catch bottom steps went hour old gentleman already exhausted working night tired went back office bottom steps could believe first sent somebody go look behind door see really gather together probably even dare complain far lawyers job introduce improvements court system even want even junior lawyer understand relationship extent one significant point almost every defendant even simple people begins think suggestions improving court soon proceedings begun many often even spend time energy matter could spent far better elsewhere right thing learn deal situation even possible improve detail anyway superstitious nonsense best could achieve although incalculable harm process attracted special attention officials case comes future officials always ready seek revenge never attract attention stay calm however much goes character try gain insight size court organism extent remains state suspension even alter something one place draw ground feet might fall whereas enormous organism like court disrupted one place finds easy provide substitute somewhere else everything connected everything else continue without change else quite probable even closed attentive strict malevolent best leave work lawyers keep disturbing much good make accusations especially ca make clear based full significance must said caused great deal harm case behaviour towards office director influential man might well struck list might anything trial mentioned even passing quite obvious ignoring officials many ways like children often something quite harmless although behaviour could unfortunately called harmless leave feeling offended even stop talking good friends turn away see everything oppose particular reason surprisingly enough little joke ever attempted everything seemed hopeless make laugh reconciled difficult hard time deal hardly reason sometimes quite astonishing single average life enough encompass much possible ever success one work hand also dark moments everyone think achieved nothing seems trials come good end determined good end start would without help others lost despite running fro effort little apparent successes gave joy longer feel sure anything asked trial well nature turned worse assisted would even dare deny even kind one left lawyers especially vulnerable fits depression sort fits depression course case suddenly taken hands conducting satisfactorily time probably worst happen lawyer accused takes case away hardly ever happens defendant taken certain lawyer stay whatever happens could ever carry taken help lawyer happen sometimes happen trial takes course lawyer may go along client trial simply taken away lawyer even contact court officials wo help however good know anything trial entered stage help given processed courts access defendant even contacted lawyer come home one day find documents submitted worked hard create best hopes lying desk sent back ca carried next stage trial worthless scraps paper mean case lost least decisive reason supposing know anything case told anything happening well cases like exceptions glad say even trial one still time long way still plenty opportunity lawyers get work could sure would made use said time submitting documents still future rush prepare much important start initial discussions appropriate officials already taken place varying degrees success must said much better give away details time way could influenced unfavourably hopes might raised might made anxious better say individuals spoken favourably shown willing help although others spoken less favourably even way refused help results encouraging certainly draw particular conclusions preliminary proceedings begin way way developed would show value preliminary proceedings anyway nothing lost yet succeed getting office director despite everything side several actions undertaken end everything clean wound surgeon would say wait results comfort started talking way lawyer quite tireless went every time went see always progress could never told sort progress first set documents submitted worked still ready usually turned great advantage next time went see earlier occasion would bad time put could known stupefied talking ever pointed even considering difficulties progress slow lawyer would object progress slow might progressed far come right time come late lateness would bring still difficulties time concerned welcome interruption visits always leni contrived bring lawyer tea would stand behind pretending watch lawyer bent greedily cup poured tea drank secretly let hold hand always complete silence lawyer drank squeezed hand leni would sometimes dare gently stroke hair still lawyer would ask ready wanted take dishes away said leni would give hands final squeeze lawyer would wipe mouth start talking renewed energy lawyer trying comfort confuse could tell seemed clear defence good hands maybe everything lawyer said quite right even though obviously wanted make conspicuous possible probably never even taken case important said still suspicious continually mentioned personal contacts civil servants exploited solely benefit lawyer never forgot mention dealing junior officials meant officials dependent others direction taken trial could important furtherment could making use lawyer turn trials certain direction would course always cost defendant certainly mean would every trial likely probably also trials gave lawyer advantages room needed turn direction wanted would also advantage keep reputation intact really relationship would direct trial lawyer explained especially difficult therefore important enough attract great attention first time came court could much doubt would first signs could already seen fact first documents still submitted even though trial already lasted several months according lawyer everything still initial stages effective course making defendant passive keeping helpless could suddenly surprised verdict least notification hearing decided favour matter would passed higher office essential take hand mornings tired everything dragged lethargically head belief seemed irrefutable longer felt contempt trial earlier alone world would easy ignore although also certain case trial would never arisen first place uncle already dragged see lawyer take account family job longer totally separate progress trial carelessly certain inexplicable complacency mentioned acquaintances others learned ways know relationship miss bürstner seemed trouble short longer choice whether would accept trial turn middle defend tired bad reason worry much needed capable working high position bank relatively short time retain respect everyone simply apply talents made possible trial doubt turn well important thing something achieved reject advance idea might way guilty guilt trial nothing big piece business like already concluded benefit bank many times piece business concealed many lurking dangers waiting ambush usually dangers would need defended achieved must entertain idea guilt whatever would need look interests closely could seen way choice take representation away lawyer soon best evening lawyer told talked something unheard would probably great deal harm could tolerate impediment efforts trial concerned impediments probably caused lawyer shaken lawyer documents would need submitted straight away possible would need see dealt every day would course enough done sit corridor hat bench like others day day one women somebody else behalf would run officials force sit desks study documents instead looking corridor grating could efforts everything would need organised supervised time court came defendant knew defend make use rights confidence try difficulty composing documents much earlier week could felt shame thought made write documents never entered head task could also difficult remembered one morning already piled work suddenly shoved everything one side took pad paper sketched thoughts documents sort proceed perhaps would offer lawyer door office opened deputy director entered room loud laugh embarrassed although deputy director course laughing documents knew nothing joke heard joke needed illustration understood deputy director leant desk took pencil hand drew illustration writing pad intended ideas case thoughts shame documents prepared submitted likely could find time office would home night nights enough would take holiday could stop half way nonsense business always everywhere needless say documents would mean almost endless amount work easy come belief anxious disposition impossible ever finish laziness deceit things might hindered lawyer preparing know charge even consequences might bring remember every tiny action event whole life looking sides checking reconsidering also disheartening job would suitable way passing long days retired become senile needed apply thoughts work still rising already posed threat deputy director every hour passed quickly wanted enjoy brief evenings nights young man time start working documents began feel resentment almost involuntarily put end finger felt button electric bell pressed glanced clock eleven two hours spent great deal costly time dreaming wits course even dulled time nonetheless wasted come decisions could value well various pieces mail servitors brought two visiting cards gentlemen already waiting time actually important clients bank really kept waiting circumstances come awkward time gentlemen side closed door seemed asking industrious using best business time private affairs tired gone tired anticipation follow stood receive first short jolly man manufacturer knew well apologised disturbing important work part apologised kept manufacturer waiting long even apology spoken mechanical way false intonation manufacturer would certainly noticed fully preoccupied business affairs instead hurriedly pulled calculations tables pockets spread front explained several items corrected little mistake arithmetic noticed quickly glanced reminded similar piece business concluded year mentioning passing time another bank spending great effort get business finally stopped speaking order learn opinion matter indeed first closely following manufacturer saying aware important deal unfortunately last soon stopped listening nodded manufacturer louder exclamations short eventually stopped even stare bald head bent papers asking manufacturer would finally realise everything saying useless stop talking really thought first would chance confess incapable listening instead seeing anticipation manufacturer face obviously ready counter objections made sorry realise business discussion continued bent head given order began slowly move pencil papers would stop stare one figures manufacturer thought must objection perhaps figures really sound perhaps decisive issue whatever thought manufacturer covered papers hand began moving close explain deal difficult said pursing lips thing could offer guidance papers manufacturer covered view sank back arm chair even door manager office opened revealed clearly veil deputy director look weakly thought matter merely watched immediate effect deputy director appearance effect pleasing manufacturer immediately jumped seat hurried meet deputy director although would liked make ten times livelier feared deputy director might disappear need worried two gentlemen met shook hand went together desk manufacturer said sorry find chief clerk little inclined business pointing view deputy director bent back papers two men leant desk manufacturer made effort gain keep deputy director attention felt much bigger really negotiations carefully slowly turning eyes upwards tried learn taking place took one papers desk without looking see lay flat hand raised slowly rose level two men particular plan mind merely felt would act finished preparing great document remove burden entirely deputy director paying attention conversation glance paper read written important chief clerk important took hand saying thank already familiar everything laid calmly back desk gave bitter sideways look deputy director notice notice raised spirits frequently laughed loud one time clearly embarrassed manufacturer raised objection witty way drew immediately back embarrassment commenting adversely finally invited office could bring matter conclusion important matter said manufacturer understand completely sure chief clerk even said actually speaking manufacturer glad us take hands something needs calm consideration seems today even people room outside waiting hours still enough control turn away deputy director direct friendly albeit stiff smile manufacturer made retaliation bent slightly supported hands desk like clerk watched two gentlemen still talking took papers desk disappeared manager office doorway manufacturer turned said would make farewell yet would course let chief clerk know success discussions also little something tell last enter head show anyone else office became vaguely aware nice people outside thought still negotiating manufacturer reason could let anyone see even servitor went window sat ledge beside held firmly handle looked onto square outside snow still falling weather still brightened remained long time sitting way knowing actually made anxious occasionally glance slightly startled shoulder door outer room mistakenly thought heard noise came made feel calmer went wash stand rinsed face cold water head somewhat clearer went back place window decision take defence hands seemed burden originally assumed left defence lawyer trial little basic affect observed afar something scarcely able reach directly suited looked see things stood also able draw head back whenever wanted contrast conduct defence would devote entirely court time least success would mean later complete conclusive liberation achieve would place start far greater danger far ever felt tempted doubt experience deputy director manufacturer day would quite enough convince could sat totally convinced need defence would later would life like days ahead would find way happy conclusion carefully worked defence sort would made sense carefully worked defence also mean would need shut everything else much could would survive succeed conducting bank involved much submitting documents could probably prepare days leave although would great temerity ask time bank time whole trial way seeing long might last enormous difficulty suddenly thrown life supposed bank work time like looked desk supposed let people see go negotiations time like trial trundled court officials upstairs attic room sat looking papers trial worrying business bank seem like kind torture acknowledged court connected trial followed around likely anyone bank judging work would take account peculiar situation never knew trial although quite clear knew much hoped rumours reached far deputy director otherwise would obviously soon find way making use harm would show neither comradeship humaneness director true well disposed towards soon heard trial would probably try everything could make easier would certainly devote one time provided deputy director said director coming influence deputy director would also exploit weakened condition director strengthen power could hope maybe considerations sort weakened power resistance still necessary deceive oneself see everything clearly could seen moment particular reason avoiding returning desk opened window difficult open turn handle hands whole height breadth window mixture fog smoke drawn room filling slight smell burning flakes snow blown horrible autumn said manufacturer come room unnoticed seeing deputy director stood behind nodded looked uneasily manufacturer briefcase would probably take papers inform result negotiations deputy director however manufacturer saw looking knocked briefcase without opening said wanting hear things turned already got contract pocket almost charming man deputy director got dangers though laughed shook hand wanted make laugh seemed suspicious manufacturer want show papers saw nothing comments laugh chief clerk said manufacturer expect weather affecting mood looking worried today yes said raising hand holding temple head headaches worries family quite right said manufacturer always hurry could never listen anyone long everyone cross bear unconsciously made step towards door wanting show manufacturer manufacturer said chief clerk something else like mention sorry something burden today days see twice already lately time forgot delay longer might well lose point altogether would pity think got say value time answer manufacturer came close tapped knuckle lightly chest said quietly got trial going stepped back immediately exclaimed deputy director telling said manufacturer would deputy director know asked already control hear things court said manufacturer even applies wanted tell many people connections court said lowered head led manufacturer desk sat manufacturer said afraid much got tell matters like best overlook tiniest details besides really want help way however modest help might good business partners till well wanted apologise behaviour conversation earlier day manufacturer would tolerate interruption shoved briefcase high armpit show hurry carried know case certain titorelli painter titorelli artistic name even know real name coming office years time time brings little pictures buy less sake charity hardly beggar nice pictures moorland landscapes sort thing got used business way

lying also businessman like already close breaking point weight business worries ca pay much attention people perhaps thinking perhaps titorelli might able help small way knows lots judges even ca much influence give advice get influential people side even advice turn make difference still think important got nearly lawyer always say chief clerk nearly lawyer oh sure trial turn right want go see titorelli ask certainly everything possibly really think ought go need today course time get chance anyway want tell actually go see titorelli advice place obligation think get without titorelli certainly better leave completely maybe already got clear idea titorelli could upset plans case course go circumstances certainly wo easy take advice lad like still letter recommendation address disappointed took letter put pocket even best advantage might derive recommendation incomparably smaller damage lay fact manufacturer knowing trial painter spreading news could manage give manufacturer already way door words thanks go said took leave manufacturer door busy present write perhaps would like come office time sure find best solution said manufacturer although thought prefer avoid inviting people like titorelli bank talking trial always good idea send letters people like titorelli know might happen bound thought everything know ca nodded accompanied manufacturer despite seeming calm outside actually shocked told manufacturer would write titorelli show way valued recommendations would consider opportunity speak titorelli without delay thought titorelli could offer worthwhile assistance would delayed manufacturer comment made realise dangers could lead really able rely understanding little possible might invite questionable character bank clear letter ask advice trial separated deputy director door possible even likely also dangers failed see even running towards always someone beside warn would act strength could muster number doubts sort never known presented affected vigilance difficulties feeling carrying office work going affect trial least found quite unable understand could intended write titorelli invite bank shook head thought servitor came beside drew attention three gentlemen waiting bench already waiting see long time servitor speaking stood wanted make use opportunity see others negligent bank let waste time waiting room none wanted draw attention one saying told servitor fetch winter coat said three servitor helped put please forgive gentlemen afraid time see present please forgive urgent business settle leave straight

without delay businessmen like know value businessman time would like come way opened door leading office deputy director seemed good appropriating everything forced give giving absolutely running unknown painter admit little hope vague benefit renown suffering damage could repaired would probably much better take winter coat least try win back two gentlemen certainly still waiting next room glimpsed deputy director office looking something bookshelves would probably even made attempt somewhat agitated approached door deputy director called oh still left turned face toward many deep folds seemed show strength rather age immediately began search looking copy contract said gentleman insists must could help look think made step forward deputy director said thank already found big package papers certainly must included many documents copy contract turned went back office ca deal right said personal difficulties settled certainly first get effect certainly wo like slightly calmed thoughts gave servitor already long holding door corridor open task telling director able going bank business matter left bank felt almost happy thought able devote business went straight painter lived outlying part town near court offices although area even poorer houses darker streets full dirt slowly blew snow great gateway building painter lived one two doors open hole broken open wall door approached repulsive yellow steaming liquid shot causing rats scurry away nearby canal staircase small child lying belly crying could hardly heard noise side entrance hall drowning sound door workshop open three workers stood circle around piece work beating hammers large tin plate hung wall casting pale light pushed way two workers lighting faces glance things wanted get things soon

evening want go bed feel something pinching leg look bed pull another know bother like expect seen nothing encourage come near make hard work course get studio nothing moved long time ago little voice tender anxious called door titorelli come answered painter even voice asked even said painter went door locked meanwhile looking round room pointed would never occurred wretched little room could called studio hardly long enough broad enough make two steps everything floor walls ceiling made wood planks narrow gaps could seen across bed stood wall covering many different colours middle room picture stood easel covered shirt whose arms dangled ground behind window fog made impossible see snow covered roof neighbouring building turning key lock reminded wanted stay long drew manufacturer letter pocket held painter said learned gentleman acquaintance advice come painter glanced letter threw onto bed manufacturer said clearly titorelli acquaintance poor man dependent charity would really quite possible believe titorelli know least could remember impression augmented painter asking wanting buy pictures want painted looked painter astonishment letter actually say taken matter course manufacturer explained painter letter wanted nothing find trial far rash coming give painter sort answer glancing easel said working picture currently yes said painter took shirt hanging easel threw onto bed letter portrait quite good piece work although quite finished yet convenient coincidence gave good opportunity talk court picture showed clearly judge remarkably similar picture office although one showed quite different judge heavy man full beard black bushy extended sides far man cheeks lawyer picture also oil painting whereas one made pastel colours pale unclear everything else picture similar judge holding tightly arm throne seemed ominously rise first say certainly judge held back time went closer picture wanted study detail large figure shown middle throne back rest could understand asked painter need work done painter told taking pastel crayon small table added strokes edges figure without making clearer far could make figure justice said painter finally see said blindfold scales wings heels moving yes said painter paint like according contract actually figure justice goddess victory one good combination said smile justice needs remain still otherwise scales move wo possible make verdict client wanted said painter yes certainly said meant criticise anyone comment painted figure actually appears throne said painter never seen figure throne invention told paint asked pretending fully understand painter said judge sitting judge chair yes said painter judge high never sat throne like painted grand pose sitting like president court yeah gentlemen like vain said painter permission higher get painted like laid quite strictly sort portrait get pity ca make details costume pose picture pastel colours really suitable showing people like yes said seem odd pastel colours judge wanted said painter meant woman sight picture seemed make feel like working rolled shirtsleeves picked crayons watched reddish shadow built around head judge quivering tips radiated edges picture shadow play slowly surrounded head like decoration lofty distinction around figure justice apart coloration barely noticeable remained light brightness figure seemed shine forward looked like neither god justice god victory seemed rather perfect depiction god hunt found painter work engrossing wanted finally reproached staying long without done anything relevant affair name judge asked suddenly allowed tell painter answered bent deeply picture clearly neglecting guest first received care took foible painter irritated made lose time take must trustee court said painter immediately put crayons stood upright rubbed hands together looked smile always straight truth said want learn something court like says letter recommendation start talking pictures get side still wo hold know entirely wrong thing try oh please said sharply repelling attempt make objection continued besides quite right comment trustee court made pause wanting give time come terms fact girls could heard behind door probably pressed around keyhole perhaps could even see room gaps planks forewent opportunity excuse way wish distract painter saying else perhaps want get far way make extent unattainable asked publicly acknowledged position painter curt reply question prevented saying wanted continue speaking said well positions like officially acknowledged often influence said painter nodded frown talking case manufacturer yesterday asked would like help answered come see likes pleased see soon business seems quite important course surprised would like take coat intended stay short time painter invitation nonetheless welcome air room slowly become quite oppressive several times looked amazement small iron stove corner certainly could lit heat room inexplicable took winter overcoat also unbuttoned frock coat painter said apology must warmth cosy room good respect made reply actually heat made uncomfortable much stuffiness air almost made difficult breathe room probably ventilated long time unpleasantness made stronger painter invited sit bed sat chair room front easel painter even seemed misunderstand remained edge bed urged make comfortable hesitated went bed pressed deep bedclothes pillows went back seat last asked first objective question made forget everything else innocent asked yes said felt simple joy answering question especially answer given private individual therefore would consequences till asked question openly make pleasure added totally innocent said painter lowered head seemed thinking suddenly raised head said well innocent simple began scowl supposed trustee court talking like ignorant child innocent make things simple said despite everything could help smiling slowly shook head many fine details court gets lost end reaches place originally nothing pulls enormous guilt yeah yeah sure said painter disturbing train thought reason innocent well course said main thing said painter could influence although made mind clear whether talking way conviction indifference wanted find said therefore sure familiar court know hardly heard many different people agreed one thing ill accusations made ignored court made accusation convinced guilt defendant hard make think otherwise hard painter asked throwing one hand air impossible make think otherwise painted judges next canvas trying defend front success ever real court yes said forgetting gone investigate painter one girls behind door started asked titorelli going go soon quiet shouted painter door ca see talking gentleman enough satisfy girl asked going paint picture painter answer added please paint bloke followed incomprehensible interwoven babble shouts replies calls agreement painter leapt door opened slightly clasped hands could seen stretching crack wanted something said quiet throw stairs sit steps quiet probably obey immediately command steps became quiet sorry said painter returned hardly turned towards door left completely painter whether would place protection wanted even made hardly movement painter bent whispering ear order heard outside said girls belong court well asked leant head one side looked painter painter sat back chair half jest half explanation well everything belongs court something never noticed said curtly general comment painter made comment girls far less disturbing nonetheless looked door behind girls sitting quietly steps except one pushed drinking straw crack planks moving slowly still seem much general idea court said painter stretched legs wide apart tapping loudly floor tip foot innocent wo need anyway get intend asked say long ago quite impossible go court reasons proofs impossible reasons proofs take court said painter raising forefinger failed notice fine distinction goes differently try something behind public court say consultation rooms corridors instance studio began find far easier believe painter saying rather largely agreement also told others fact even quite promising really easy influence judges personal contacts lawyer said painter contacts vain judges especially important least undervalued painter would fit well circle assistants slowly gathering around noted bank talent organising placed entirely resources would good opportunity test talent limits painter observed effect explanation certain unease said occur way speaking almost like lawyer incessant contact gentlemen court influence gain lot course lose lot artistically speaking first come contact judges asked wanted first gain painter trust took service easy said painter inherited contacts father court painter position always inherited ca use new people rules governing various grades officials painted many varied secret outside certain families even knows drawer instance got father notes show anyone able paint judges know say although even lost could ever dispute position rules carry round head judges want painted like old great judges one envied said thinking position bank position quite unassailable yes quite unassailable said painter raised shoulders pride even afford help poor man facing trial asked painter described poor man painter let distracted said case instance totally innocent repeated mention innocence becoming irksome sometimes seemed painter using comments make favourable outcome trial precondition help course would make help unnecessary despite doubts forced interrupt painter want without painter help decided help seem way less questionable lawyer valued painter help far highly offered way harmless open painter pulled seat closer bed continued subdued voice forgot ask sort acquittal want three possibilities absolute acquittal apparent acquittal deferment absolute acquittal best course nothing could get sort outcome think anyone could anything get absolute acquittal probably thing could accused innocent innocent could actually possible could depend innocence alone case wo need kind help first astonished orderly explanation quietly painter said think contradicting asked painter patiently leaning back smile smile made feel examining words painter seeking inconsistencies procedures court nonetheless continued unabashed said remarked earlier court approached reasoned proofs later restricted open court go far say innocent man needs assistance court entails contradiction moreover said earlier judges influenced personally insist absolute acquittal call never attained personal influence entails second contradiction quite easy clear contradictions said painter talking two different things says law know experience get two confused never seen writing law course say one hand innocent set free hand say judges influenced experience way round know absolute acquittals know many times judge influenced possible course innocence cases know likely single innocent defendant many cases boy used listen closely father told us court cases home judges came studio talked court circles nobody talks anything else hardly ever got chance go court always made use could listened countless trials important stages development followed closely far could followed say never seen single acquittal single acquittal said talking hopes confirms impression already court point side either could replace whole court single hangman generalise said painter dissatisfied talking experience well enough said heard acquittals happened earlier say acquittals earlier painter answered hard sure courts make final conclusions public even judges allowed know know earlier cases legends involve absolute acquittals believe ca proved hand forget either sure truth beautiful painted pictures depicting legends assessment altered mere legends said suppose possible cite legends court painter laughed ca cite court said point talking said wanted time accept anything painter told even thought unlikely contradicted told others time examine truth everything painter said even disprove would achieved much could painter would help way even help would decisive result said let pay attention absolute acquittal mentioned two possibilities apparent acquittal deferment possibilities said painter talk would like take coat must hot yes said paid attention nothing painter explanations heat pointed brow began sweat heavily almost unbearable painter nodded understood discomfort well could open window asked said painter fixed pane glass ca opened realised time hoping painter would suddenly go window pull open prepared even fog would breathe open mouth thought entirely cut air made feel dizzy tapped lightly bedspread beside weak voice said inconvenient unhealthy oh said painter defence window ca opened room retains heat better window double glazed even though single pane much need air room much ventilation gaps wood want open one doors even slightly consoled explanation looked around see second door painter saw said behind hide behind bed able see little door wall really much small studio said painter wanted anticipate objection would make arrange things well could obviously bad place bed front door instance judge painting present comes always comes door bed even given key door wait studio home although nowadays usually comes early morning still asleep course always wakes hear door opened beside bed however fast asleep could hear way curse climbs bed morning lose respect judges suppose could take key away make things worse takes tiny effort break doors hinges time painter speaking considering whether take coat finally realised would quite unable stay longer took frock coat lay knee could put back soon conversation hardly done one girls called taken coat could heard pressing around gaps planks see spectacle girls think going paint portrait said painter taking coat see said slightly amused felt little better even though sat shirtsleeves irritation asked say two possibilities already forgotten terms used apparent acquittal deferment said painter one choose get either help take effort course difference apparent acquittal needs concentrated effort deferment takes much less effort sustained apparent acquittal want write assertion innocence piece paper text assertion sort passed father quite unassailable take assertion round judges know start one currently painting put assertion comes sitting evening lay assertion front explain innocent give personal guarantee superficial guarantee real one binding painter eyes seemed show reproach wanting impose sort responsibility would kind said would judge believe nonetheless pass absolute acquittal like said answered painter anyway entirely sure judges would believe many instance might want bring see personally come along least happens matter half way especially teach advance exactly need act judge concerned course also happens though judges turn advance worse certainly make several attempts still forget least afford one judge pass decisive verdict got enough judges signatures document take judge concerned case might even signature already case things develop bit quicker would otherwise usually many hold ups time defendant feel confident odd true people feel confidence time acquitted particular exertion needed document asserting innocence guaranteed number judges judge acquit without worries although still several formalities gone doubt favour several acquaintances however walk court free free said hesitantly right said painter apparently free put better way temporarily free junior judges ones know right give final acquittal highest judge court quite reach us know things look incidentally want know right acquit people major privilege judges right free people indictment say freed way time charge withdrawn still hanging heads takes order higher bring back force good contact court also tell difference absolute apparent acquittal described superficial way directives court offices absolute acquittal proceedings stop everything disappears process indictment trial even acquittal disappears everything disappears apparent acquittal different happens nothing changed except case innocence acquittal grounds acquittal made stronger apart proceedings go court offices continue business case gets passed higher courts gets passed back lower courts backwards forwards sometimes faster sometimes slower fro impossible know exactly happening going seen outside sometimes seem everything long since forgotten documents lost acquittal complete familiar court would believe documents ever get lost court forgets nothing one day expects judge picks documents looks closely notices particular case still active orders defendant immediate arrest talking long delay apparent acquittal quite possible know cases like likely defendant goes home acquitted finds somebody waiting course life free man end trial start asked finding
